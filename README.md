Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
I performed a detailed analysis of the data, using the data of the Toronto Neighborhoods (Specifically those with the word Toronto in their names). Using the venues information from the original file, it was possible clustered the city based on the main venues of the neighborhoods, for example: if there exist coffe shops, parks, etc.
